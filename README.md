# Azure Engineer assessment

The goal of this test is to asses yourself and open a path to a clear and concise technical interview.

Remember, you already went through our screening and first interview; this is the beginning and preparation for a mutual technical conversation.

## Azure Storage Account

You got a request to create an Azure storage account. 

- What questions would you send it back? 
- After they are answered and you have to start working, how would you configure and secure that account?

A .net developer using a Windows machine is tired of going into the console to see if his application is writing correctly to the Blob Storage you configured.

- How can you help him and show the way to make this easier?

Explain you steps and impression in `MyExperience.md`.

## VNet-to-VNet
You have to create Two VNets on Azure using ARM. 
- Explain what questions you would ask to make sure that this is reasonable? 
- Considering it is, you get a request to test if a VM on one VNet can talk to a VM on the other... if not, you have to make it work. What would be the easiest and fastest way to do it? 
- Now do the above (apply your "peering") using an automation tool as well (ARM, Terraform, Ansible, ...).

Push your code and explain you steps, and impression in `MyExperience.md`.

## Application Gateway

- What are the best use cases for having an Azure Application Gateway?

- Create one with an automation tool (ARM, Terraform, Ansible, ...) that has Level 7 web traffic routing and a custom URL-based path rule.

Push your code and explain you steps, and impression in `MyExperience.md`.
