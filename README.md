# Azure Engineer assessment

The goal of this test is to asses yourself and open a path to a clear and concise technical interview.

Remember, you already went through our screening and first interview; this is the beginning and preparation for a mutual technical conversation.

## Azure Storage Account

You got a request to create an Azure storage account. What questions would you send it back? After they are answered and you have to start working, how would you configure and secure that account?

A .net developer using a Windows machine is tired of going into the console to see if his application is writing correctly to the Blob Storage you configured... how can you help him and show the way to make this easier?

Explain you steps and impression in `MyExperience.md`.

## VNet-to-VNet
You have to create Two VNets on Azure using Terraform. That is a hard demand from the architecture team. Explain what questions you would ask to make sure that this is reasonable? Considering it is, you get a request to test if a VM on one VNet can talk to a VM on the other... if not, you have to make it work. What would be the easiest and fastest way to do it? Apply your "peering" using an automation tool as well (Terraform, Ansible, ...).

Explain you steps and impression in `MyExperience.md`.

## Application Gateway

What are the best use cases for having an Azure Application Gateway?
Create one with terraform that has Level 7 web traffic routing and a custom URL-based path rule.

Explain you steps and impression in `MyExperience.md`.
